   files
3. Create an empty directory called "dataset"
4. Create a directory in "dataset" called "mmsi-daily-csvs-10-v2-2020" containing each vessel activity CSV file in the unzipped mmsi-daily-csvs-10-v2-2020 folder
5. Create a directory in "dataset" called "vessel" with the fishing-vessels-v1-5 file.
